## Problem to solve
-	Manual pen testing and reporting are time-consuming and costly
-	Routine/repetitive tasks could be automated to allow testers to focus on higher-value analysis
-	Attackers continuously target sensitive data and systems, threatening confidentiality, integrity and availability
-	Cybersecurity threat landscape evolves rapidly, making it hard to stay up to date with new threats and vulnerabilities
-	Smaller companies and non-profits often lack the resources to afford modern testing tools or frequent assessments
-	Systems may contain known, but unpatched vulnerabilities due to limited maintenance capacity
-	Test results often too technical for executives or compliance teams to interpret effectively
-	Organisations struggle to convert technical findings into prioritised, meaningful security actions
-	Increased data breaches highlight need to for accessible, proactive defence measures
