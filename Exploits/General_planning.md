##### Attack cycle
* Scope
* Reconnaissance
* Discovery
* Exploitation
* Brute forcing
* Social engineering
* Take control
* Pivoting
* Gather evidence
* Cleanup
* Report remediation

##### Considerations
1. What is the most important data to my company
   1. Credentials
   2. Bank accounts
2. Information about system (Metasploitable)
   1. Port scanning
3. Which vulnerabilities to exploit to gain access - operating or application level
4. Brute force attack tests all systems for weak passwords
   1. Move through network and attempt privilege escalation
5. Goal: gain access to data on target machines (passwords, password hashes, screenshots, files), keyloggers, take over control of target machine
   1. Proxy pivot, SOCKS
   2. VPN pivot
6. Gather evidence, screenshots, passwords, hashes, files as proof
7. Report how network was breached and which information accesses
8. Remediation to address issues

* Firewalls
* Legacy systems
* Web applications - server and client side
  * Detailed and intensive
* Load malicious code on device or network - simulate social engineering
* Firefox or software vulnerabilities

##### Stages
1. Auxiliary
2. Exploit
3. Payloads
4. Post
